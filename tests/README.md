# PHPUnit tests for oik-fields
Unit Tests are not part of the run time deliverables.

## Under Construction

These tests will be written to test oik-fields internationalization and other issues.
Some of the fields are already tested in PHPUnit tests for the oik base plugin.
There should be no need to duplicate them in this plugin.
See [How Iâ€™m testing the internationalization and localization of my WordPress plugins](https://herbmiller.me/test-internationalization-localization-wordpress-plugins/)
